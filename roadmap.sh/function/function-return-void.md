In TypeScript, when a function has a contextual type with a `void` return type (e.g., `type voidFunc = () => void`), the term "the return value is ignored" means that the function *can* return a value of any type, but TypeScript will not enforce or consider that return value in the type system. The caller of the function is not expected to use or rely on the returned value, and TypeScript treats the return as if it were `undefined` or irrelevant for type-checking purposes.

### Key Points:
1. **Void Does Not Mean "Nothing Can Be Returned"**:
   - Unlike some languages where `void` strictly means "no return value," in TypeScript, a `void` return type indicates that the function *may* return something (e.g., `number`, `string`, or even `undefined`), but the return value is not meant to be used by the caller.
   - TypeScript allows the function to return any value without raising a type error, as long as the function's signature is satisfied.

2. **What "Ignored" Means**:
   - The return value is "ignored" in the sense that TypeScript's type system does not care about the type of the returned value. The caller can safely assume the function returns `undefined` or nothing meaningful, even if the function implementation returns something else.
   - For example, if you assign a function that returns a `number` to a `voidFunc` type, TypeScript won't complain, but the returned `number` won't be used or checked by the caller.

3. **Does It Return `void`?**:
   - No, the function does not *literally* return `void`. The `void` type in TypeScript is a type annotation, not a runtime value. At runtime, the function might return `undefined`, a `number`, a `string`, or any other value, depending on its implementation.
   - The `void` type simply tells TypeScript to treat the return value as irrelevant and not enforce any specific type for it.

### Example:
```typescript
type voidFunc = () => void;

const myFunc: voidFunc = () => {
    return 42; // Returning a number, but TypeScript allows it
};

const result = myFunc(); // TypeScript infers `result` as `void`, but at runtime, `result` is `42`
console.log(result); // Outputs: 42
```

- Here, `myFunc` is assigned to a `voidFunc` type, which expects a `void` return type.
- The function returns `42` (a `number`), and TypeScript doesn't complain because `void` allows any return value.
- The caller (`result`) treats the return value as `void` in the type system, but at runtime, the actual value `42` is returned and can be logged.

### Why This Behavior?
- TypeScript's `void` is designed to align with JavaScript's flexible nature, where functions often return values that are ignored (e.g., event handlers or callbacks).
- For example, in event handlers, a function might return a value, but the event system ignores it:
  ```typescript
  button.onclick = () => {
      return "clicked"; // TypeScript allows this, but the browser ignores the return value
  };
  ```

### Summary:
- A `void` return type in TypeScript means the return value is "ignored" by the type system, not that the function must return nothing.
- The function can return any value at runtime, but TypeScript treats the return type as `void`, and the caller should not rely on the returned value.
- It does *not* mean the function returns `void` as a value; `void` is just a type annotation, and the actual runtime return value could be anything (e.g., `undefined`, `number`, etc.).
